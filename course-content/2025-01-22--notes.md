# Ring homomorphisms

If $R$ and $S$ are rings, a function $\phi:R \to S$ is called a *ring homomorphism*
provided that 

a. $\phi$ is a homomorphism of *additive groups*, and
b. $\phi$ preserves multiplication; i.e. for all $x,y \in R$ we have $\phi(xy) = \phi(x) \phi(y)$.
c. $\phi(1_R) = 1_S$.

The *kernel* of the ring homomorphism $\phi:R \to S$ is given by
$$\ker \phi = \phi^{-1}(0) = \{x \in R \mid \phi(x) = 0\};$$ thus
$\ker \phi$ is just the kernel of $\phi$ viewed as a homomorphism of
additive groups.

Properties of the kernel:

a. $\ker \phi$ is an additive subgroup of $R$
b. for every $r \in R$ and every $x \in \ker \phi$ we have $rx \in \ker \phi$.

# Ideals of a ring

For simplicity suppose that the ring $R$ (and $S$) are *commutative*
rings.

A subset $I$ of $R$ is an *ideal* provided that

a. $I$ is an additive subgroup of $R$, and
b. for every $r \in R$ and every $x \in I$ we have $rx \in I$.

We sometimes describe condition b. by saying that "$I$ is closed under
multiplication by every element of $R$".

The proof of the following is immediate from definitions:

**Proposition** 
:   If $\phi:R \to S$ is a ring homomorphism , then $\ker \phi$ is an
    ideal of $R$.


# Quotient rings

Let $R$ be a commutative ring and $I$ an ideal of $R$.

Since $I$ is a subgroup of the (abelian) additive group $R$, we may
consider the quotient group $R/I$. Its elements are (additive) cosets
$a + I$ for $a \in R$.

It follows from the definition of cosets that the $a+I = b+I$ if and
only if $b - a \in I$.

The additive group can be made into a commutative ring by defining the
multiplication as follows:

For $a + I, b+I \in R/I$ (so that $a,b\in R$), the product is given
by $$(a+I)(b+I) = ab + I.$$

In order to make this definition, one must confirm that this rule is well-defined. Namely,
if we have equalities $a+I = a' + I$ and $b+I = b'+I$, we need to know that
$$(a+I)(b+I) = (a'+I)(b'+I).$$

Applying the definition, we see that we must confirm that
$$ab = I = a'b' + I.$$
For this, we need to argue that $a'b' - ab \in I$.

Since $a+I = a' +I$, we know that $a' - a = x \in I$ and since
$b+I=b'+I$ we know that $b' - b = y \in I$.

Thus $a' = a + x$ and $b' = b + y$.  Now we see that $$a'b' =
(a+x)(b+y) = ab + ay + xb + xy$$ Since $I$ is an ideal, we see that
$ay,xb,xy \in I$ henc $ay + xb + xy \in I$. Now conclude that $a'b' +
I = ab + I$ as required.

It is now straightforward to confirm that the ring axioms hold for the
set $R/I$ with these operations. 

**Proposition**
:   If $I$ is an ideal of the commutative ring $R$, then $R/I$ is a
    commutative ring with the addition and multiplication just
    described.
  

# Principal ideals

If $R$ is a commutative ring and $a \in R$, the *principal ideal generated by $a$* -- written
$Ra$ or $\langle a \rangle$ -- is defined by
$$Ra  = \langle a \rangle = \{ ra \mid r \in R\}.$$

**Proposition**
:   For $a \in R$, $Ra$ is an *ideal* of $R$.

 

**Example**
:   Let $n \in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ and consider the principal ideal
    $n\mathbb{Z}$ of the ring $\mathbb{Z}$ generated by $n \in
    \mathbb{Z}$.
	
	As an additive group, $n\mathbb{Z}$ is the infinite cyclic group generated by $n$.
	
	The quotient ring $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ is the finite
    commutative ring with $n$ elements; these elements are precisely
    the *congruence classes* of integers modulo $n$.

# Isomorphism Theorem

**Theorem**
:   Let $R,S$ be commutative rings with identity and let $\phi:R \to
    S$ be a ring homomorphism. Assume that $\phi$ is *surjective*
    (i.e. *onto*). Then $\phi$ determines an isomorphism 
	$\overline{\phi}:R/I \to S$ where $I = \ker \phi$, where $\overline{\phi}$ is determined by the rule
	$$\overline{\phi}(a+I) = \phi(a) \quad \text{for $a \in R$}.$$

**Outline of proof**

First, you must confirm that $\overline{\phi}$ is *well-defined*; i.e. that if $a + I = a' + I$ then
$\overline{\phi}(a+I) = \overline{\phi}(a' + I).$

Next, you must confirm that $\overline{\phi}$ is a ring homomorphism
(this is immediate from the definition of ring operations on $R/I$).

Finally, you must confirm that $\ker \overline{\phi} = \{0\}$, where
here $0$ refers to the additive identity of the quotient ring
$R/I$. This additive identity is of course the trivial coset $I = 0 +
I \in R/I$.


# Polynomial ring example

If $F$ is a field and $a \in F$, consider the mapping $$\Phi:F[T] \to
F$$ given by $\Phi(f(T)) = f(a)$. Namely, applying $\Phi$ to a
polynomial $f(T)$ results in the value $f(a)$ of $f(T)$ at $a$.

The definition of multiplication in $F[T]$ guarantees that $\Phi$ is a
ring homomorphism.
