*This is still in draft form...*

# Problem-sets {#problem-sets}

  You may work together with classmates while solving the *problem
  sets* -- you are free to share mathematical and computational ideas
  with other students in the course. However, *you must write any
  work you submit* -- do not directly copy anyone else's work!

  Your solutions/submissions will be marked to reflect the following
  criteria:

  - mathematical correctness
  
    Is the solution mathematically valid? 
  
  - explanation and exposition

	Have the assumptions and hypotheses been explained?  Does the
	solution efficiently explain the steps leading to the conclusion?
