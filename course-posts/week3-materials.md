- [lecture notes](/course-content/lecture-notes.pdf)  
  ยง3 was Monday and ยง4 was Wednesday

  There is a bit of revisionism in the notes. During the lecture on
  Wednesday I noticed that I got something a bit out of order. I
  "fixed" the issue while lecturing, but have made a different
  (better) fix to the lecture notes. The material on zero-divisors and
  integral domains is now in ยง3.1 (rather than in or around ยง4.2).

- [Problem set 2](/course-assignments/PS2--polynomials.pdf) due ~~2025-01-31~~ 2025-02-02

  Note: I expected to talk about irreducible elements in a PID but
  didn't quite get there. So I've removed problem 2 from the
  assignment; it'll probably re-appear next week.
