  ยง3 was Monday and ยง4 was Wednesday

  There is a bit of revisionism in the notes. During the lecture on
  Wednesday I noticed that I got something a bit out of order. I
  "fixed" the issue while lecturing, but have made a different
  (better) fix to the lecture notes. The material on zero-divisors and
  integral domains is now in ยง3.1 (rather than in or around ยง4.2).
