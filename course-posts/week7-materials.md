title   : Week 7
date    : 2025-02-24

- I've updated the [lecture notes](/course-content/lecture-notes.pdf) with material for this week.

  - I'll finish discussing the material in ยง9 before moving on to new stuff.

  Here is what is new in the notes:
  
  - rational roots test (which I somehow "forgot" to do). I've
    placed this result "earlier" in the notes -- you can find it in ยง7.2.
  - constructible real numbers ยง10
 
- the homework this week mainly concerns material in ยง9.

  [Problem set 5](/course-assignments/PS5--field-extensions-and-degree.pdf) due
