- Monday Feb 17 is a holiday; no class.

- Miderm 1 will be Wednesday Feb 19.

  [Here is some review material](/course-content/exam1-review.pdf) for the exam.  
  [solutions to review material](/course-content/exam1-review-solutions.pdf).


  Note: I had originally omitted part of the statement of problem V.6 (I hadn't told you what the symbol $\gamma$ stood for). I've updated the PDF.


- the fourth problem set is now due the Sunday *after* the exam
  (rather than before the exam).

  [Problem set 4](/course-assignments/PS4--extensions.pdf) due
  2025-02-23 
  
  (also, I fixed a type/mistake in the statement of problem 2 of ps4, so make
  sure you get the latest version which indicates that it was "updated
  on 2025-02-13")
