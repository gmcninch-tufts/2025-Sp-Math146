## Course Grading & Expectations   {#grading-and-expect}


*You should keep up with the posted material throughout the  course!!*


Your grade in the course will be based on  *problem sets*,
*engagement*, two *midterm reports* and a *final report*.

Here are details on these course components:

- *weekly problem sets*, 

  Since the class meets on Mondays and Wednesdays, problem sets will
  be collected weekly on *Fridays* (some weeks, a midterm report --
  see below -- will instead by collected on Friday). You can find the
  planned collection schedule on the course website.

  A total of 10 problem sets will be collected.

  The problems will be posted on the course website, and your
  solutions will be submitted to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/) -- see [these remarks
  concerning use of
  gradescope](/course-posts/resources--gradescope.html).



- 2 take-home *midterms*

- 1 take-home *final exam*

Please refer to the course website for details on expectations
concerning these course components.

Your score in the course will be determined from these grading components by the
following (implicit) formula:

Table: **Grading**

| grade component | percentage |
|:----------------|:-----------|
| problem sets    | 40%        |
| midterm 1       | 20%        |
| midterm 2       | 20%        |
| final           | 20%        |

-------

Your *letter grade* is then determined from this score using [the
scheme described at this
