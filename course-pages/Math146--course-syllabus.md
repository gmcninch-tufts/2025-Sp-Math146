# Schedule & Format

- **Professor: **[George McNinch](http://gmcninch.math.tufts.edu)

- There is no required textbook for the course. 

  In the interest of having a *written reference* as the course
  proceeds, I'm going to loosely follow the development given in the
  text
  
  *Galois Theory*, Ian Stewart. (CRC Press, 4th edition 2022).

# Course Grading & Expectations   {#grading-and-expect}


*You should keep up with the posted material throughout the  course!!*


Your grade in the course will be based on  *problem sets*,
*engagement*, two *midterm reports* and a *final report*.

Here are details on these course components:

- *weekly problem sets*, 

  Since the class meets on Mondays and Wednesdays, problem sets will
  be collected weekly on *Fridays* (some weeks, a midterm report --
  see below -- will instead by collected on Friday). [Here is the
  planned collection
  schedule](/course-pages/Math087--Assignments--AY2023-2024spring.html).

  A total of 10 problem sets will be collected.

  The problems will be posted on the course website, and your
  solutions will be submitted to [Gradescope] -- see [these remarks
  concerning use of
  gradescope](/course-posts/resources--gradescope.html).


- 2 take-home *midterms*

- 1 take-home *final exam*

Please refer to the [rubric and
expectation](/course-posts/resources--expectations-and-rubrics.html) for further
remarks concerning these course components.

Your score in the course will be determined from these grading components by the
following (implicit) formula:

Table: **Grading**

| grade component | percentage |
|:----------------|:-----------|
| problem sets    | 40%        |
| midterm 1       | 20%        |
| midterm 2       | 20%        |
| final           | 20%        |

-------

Your *letter grade* is then determined from this score using [the
scheme described at this
link](https://math.tufts.edu/resources/grading-schemes).
